------------------------------------

Prerequisites: JDK 7, Maven 3

Reader is organized in several Maven modules:

First off, clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/sismics/reader.git`
or download the sources from GitHub.

#### Launch the build

From the `reader-parent` directory:

    mvn clean -DskipTests install

#### Run a stand-alone version

From the `reader-web` directory:

    mvn jetty:run

#### Build a .war to deploy to your servlet container

You will get your deployable WAR in the `target` directory.
